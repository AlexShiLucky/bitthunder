\section{Introduction}

BitThunder aims to fill the middle groud between FreeRTOS and Linux. In fact the primary
scheduler used is currently FreeRTOS, however this can easily be exchanged with a tasking
kernel of your choice. In the future we may even provide our own kernel that more closely
integrates with BitThunder.

BitThunder can be compiled as a fully-fledged RTOS, but also there is an option to compile
BitThunder as a library. This will allow Windows and Linux applications to take advantage
of some nice structures and APIs. E.g. linked lists and B+Trees etc.

BitThunder aims to remain real-time, while providing some advanced features like
process isolation, device management, and tracing etc.
