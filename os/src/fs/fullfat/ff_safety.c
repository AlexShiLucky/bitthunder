 *	@brief		Provides semaphores, and thread-safety for FullFAT.
 *
 *	This module aims to be as portable as possible. It is necessary to modify
 *	the functions FF_CreateSemaphore, FF_PendSemaphore, FF_ReleaseSemaphore,
 *  and FF_DestroySemaphore, as appropriate for your platform.
 *
 *	If your application has no OS and is therefore single threaded, simply
 *	have:
 *
 *	FF_CreateSemaphore() return NULL.
 *
 *	FF_PendSemaphore() should do nothing.
 *
 *	FF_ReleaseSemaphore() should do nothing.
 *
 *	FF_DestroySemaphore() should do nothing.
