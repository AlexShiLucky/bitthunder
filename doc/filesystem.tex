BitThunder also provides an advanced file-system architecture, with optional support
for a fully asychronous (event-driven) mode. The lower-level block device driver
provides automated buffer caching, and support block queues.

Devices which can optimised access based on a block buffer queue can utilise this to perform
more efficient data transfers. Simple devices can simple process these queues sequentially,
and expose a much simpler BlockRead and BlockWrite definition.
